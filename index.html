                <p id="biography">Hi, I’m Sydney! I’m a math major at the University of Texas at Austin with a passion for teaching and problem-solving. 
                    I’ve been offering swim lessons for over five years, and I absolutely love helping people of all ages improve their swimming skills. 
                    Whether you're a beginner or looking to refine your strokes, my approach combines clear instruction with patience and a personal touch. 
                    I believe that learning to swim should be both fun and empowering, and I’m excited to guide you every step of the way as you achieve your goals!</p>
